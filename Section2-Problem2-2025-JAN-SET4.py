# ompute Running Average Skipping NaN
# Read numbers from the input until the line END and print the running average after adding each number as float with one decimal place. If NaN is encountered, ignore it and do not take it into account or print anything for that.

# Running Average is the average of the numbers encountered so far.

# Use round(num,1) for printing the average.

# NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

# Example

# Input

# 2
# 4
# 6
# NaN
# 8
# END
# Output

# 2.0
# 3.0
# 4.0
# 5.0
# Explanation

# The average with 2 is just 2, so 2.0
# The average of 2 and 4 is 3, 3.0
# The average of 2, 4 and 6 is (2+3+6)/3 = 4.0
# The fourth line is NaN this nothing is updated or printed.
# The average is (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5.0
